"""This directory holds the package's recipe: its manifest and its templates.

The recipe is what *Use in an application* in the README lists, written as
data: the bundle to list, the environment variable to declare, and the steps
only a person can take. An application applies it with
``xtr-recipes recipes:sync``, which finds this module through the
``xtr_recipes`` entry point.

Nothing is importable from here. The manifest is read as a file, so a recipe
is the same from a wheel as from a working tree.
